# FullComboPercentageCounter
 
Full Combo Percentage Counter is a custom counter which can be used with Counters+.
It shows your percentage without misses or bad cuts.
This is the first mod I've made. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Available settings:
- Decimal Precision: Change the precision of the counter from 0 decimals up to 4 decimals.

Known bugs:
- Counters+ shows the default icon instead of my custom icon.

Ideas for Future Features:
- Change counter size.
- Toggleable counter name.
- Ignore multiplier.
- Split percentage for left & right saber.
