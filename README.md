# FullComboPercentageCounter
 
Full Combo Percentage Counter is a custom counter which is used with Counters+.
It shows your percentage without misses, bad cuts, or any other thing that may lower your combo.
This is the first mod I've made. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Available settings:
- Decimal Precision: The precision of the counter from 0 decimals up to 4 decimals.
- Percentage Size: The size of the counter value.
- Enable Label: Enables the label.
- Label Above Count: Put the label above the number, similar to a usual Counters+ counter.
- Ignore Multiplier Ramp-up: When this is enabled all cuts will be weighed the same.
- Show On Results Screen: Select if or when the persentage should be shown on the results screen.

Extra settings in config file:
- Label Text Prefix: The text used for the label if "LabelAboveCount" is false.
- Label Text Above Count: The text used for the label if "LabelAboveCount" is true.
- Label Offset Above Count: The offset of the label when shown above the counter.
- Label Size Above Count: The size of the label when shown above the counter.
- Result Screen Score Prefix: The text used as prefix for the score on the results screen.
- Result Screen Percentage Prefix: The text used as prefix for the percentage on the results screen.

Ideas for Future Features:
- Counter: Add setting to show FC Score
- Counter & Results: Add setting to split percentage for left & right saber.
- Results: Add setting to show difference in score and percentage compared to highscore (similar to the ScorePercentage mod)
- Remove dependency on Counters+
  - Add settings to the mods menu (possibly only when Counters+ is not installed?)
- Make extra settings accessible through the mods menu.
