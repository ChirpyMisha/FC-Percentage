# FullComboPercentageCounter
 
Full Combo Percentage Counter is a custom counter which can be used with Counters+.
It shows your percentage without misses or bad cuts.
This is the first mod I've made. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Available settings:
- Decimal Precision: Change the precision of the counter from 0 decimals up to 4 decimals.

- [No known bugs]

- True accuracy mode (Ignore multiplier ramp-up at the start of the song).
- Split percentage for left & right saber.
- Show final percentage after song on the overview view.
