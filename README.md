# FullComboPercentageCounter
 
Full Combo Percentage Counter is a custom counter which is used with Counters+.
It shows your percentage without misses, bad cuts, or any other thing that may lower your combo.
This is the first mod I've made. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Available settings:
- Decimal Precision: The precision of the counter from 0 decimals up to 4 decimals.
- Percentage Size: The size of the counter value.
- Enable Label: Enables the label.
- Label Above Count: Put the label above the number, similar to a usual Counters+ counter.

Extra settings in config file:
- Label Text Prefix: The text used for the label if "LabelAboveCount" is false.
- Label Text Above Count: The text used for the label if "LabelAboveCount" is true.
- Label Offset Above Count: The offset of the label when shown above the counter.
- Label Size Above Count: The size of the label when shown above the counter.

Ideas for Future Features:
- True accuracy mode (Ignore multiplier ramp-up at the start of the song).
- Split percentage for left & right saber.
- Show final percentage after song on the overview view.
- Add highest accuracy to the bar below the scoresaber screen (similar to SongPlayHistoryContinued)
